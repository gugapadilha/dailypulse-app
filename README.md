  ### Application developed in Jetpack Compose with KMM(KOTLIN MULTPLATAFORM MOBILE), a simple articles/news api that shows all the latests updates in the world. I also used local database to save the latests new and display to user if they not have a internet connection at the moment. I also use Clean Architecture, Ktor, SqlDelight and MVI.
